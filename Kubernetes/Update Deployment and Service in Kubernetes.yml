An application deployed on the Kubernetes cluster requires an update with new features developed by the Nautilus application development team. The existing setup includes a deployment named nginx-deployment and a service named nginx-service. Below are the necessary changes to be implemented without deleting the deployment and service:


1.) Modify the service nodeport from 30008 to 32165

2.) Change the replicas count from 1 to 5

3.) Update the image from nginx:1.18 to nginx:latest

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 5  # Updated from 1 to 5
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest  # Updated from nginx:1.18 to nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    nodePort: 32165  # Updated from 30008 to 32165
```
```yaml
# To apply the changes, use the following kubectl commands:
kubectl apply -f path/to/your/deployment-file.yml
kubectl apply -f path/to/your/service-file.yml
```
```yaml
# Verify the updates
kubectl get deployments nginx-deployment
kubectl get services nginx-service
```
